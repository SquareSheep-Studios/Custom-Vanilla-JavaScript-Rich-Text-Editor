# Custom 100% Vanilla JavaScript Rich Text Editor #
This rich text editor is intended for use within a CMS (Content Management System) and is not supposed to replicate something like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. It is designed to help keep new content uniform and follow a standard pattern, all with the same styling and layout. This is why there are no features like "line height", "margins", "font" or "color"; as they would all be predefined in the stylesheet when establishing a unique design for your content.

## Features ##
* Built from the ground up with 100% vanilla JavaScript
* The ability to manipulate elements and change their "type" (e.g. title, heading, list element, hyperlink, image)
* Custom macros for execuring commands quickly and efficiently
* Sanitized pasting and selections
